# terraform-course

The following repository contains tasks and their solutions for the Terraform course using Azure public cloud services. The tasks are divided into:
individual days and training sections in the form of a laboratory. The content of the tasks can be found in the files `tasks.md`, and the sample code with the solution
in the `TaskX` folders.

Good luck!
